Networks play a critical role in our day to day lifes especially in todays inviroment. 
Networks are what connect everything togther, from going to the store and buying groceries to getting gas or even the traffic lights you drive through to get to those destinations.
That stuff wouldnt be possible to do as easily or effectiently without different networks working together communicating what needs to be done.
